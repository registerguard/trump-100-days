				<h1>4th Congressional District residents on President Trump</h1>

				<p class="dropcap">The first 100 days of a new term has been seen as an early benchmark for presidents since 1933 when Franklin D. Roosevelt passed a flurry of bills in that time. During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump issued a <a href="https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/_landings/contract/O-TRU-102316-Contractv02.pdf" target="_blank">“100-day action plan to Make America Great Again”</a> contract for his supporters.</p>

				<p>Conversations with a dozen voters from Oregon’s Fourth Congressional District reveal a range of emotions and perspectives on Trump’s first 100 days. More conservative voters remain solidly behind Trump despite early stumbles, while those who did not support him remain energized as they develop long-term strategies for action.</p>
				<p>An <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/1/30/1627319/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presents-the-2016-presidential-election-results-by-congressional-district" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the 2016 presidential election by Daily Kos found that this district was the most closely divided in the United States. Hillary Clinton prevailed over Trump, 46.1 percent to 46.0 percent — a mere 554 votes.</p>
				<p>The divisions remain deep. Linda Lynch, president of the Lane County League of Women Voters, noted that civility is often in short supply. As the country moves past the 100-day mark, the question of whether those divisions begin to close, or continue to widen, is open for debate.</p>

							<!-- <p>“So I think one of the things that we’re looking at here is, what really has happened and has it changed very much in the last 100 days? And the lack of civility we see in politics today and in our decision-making processes … although I don’t want to accuse our city council of being less than civil. They are quite polite and they are careful about it, which is a good model for other deliberative bodies. But there is definitely a lack of civility and tolerance, and it occurs on both sides of the political spectrum.”</p>-->
